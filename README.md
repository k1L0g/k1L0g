I'm Advancing practical IT skills on the path to a future Security Operations Center (SOC) role, and a long-term career as a Security Engineer. I design and break systems in controlled labs, and document the process to deepen expertise. This repository demonstrates projects in Active Directory, secure network topologies, and end user device management —practical experience that maps directly to SOC workflows and threat detection for high-stakes cyber defense operations

### IT Security & Systems Lab Portfolio




#### Overview
Applied practical skills in Active Directory, network security, and endpoint management through labs designed to reinforce security best practices  

These labs illustrate my ability to:

- Configure and secure IT systems  
- Apply security policies and auditing  
- Document technical processes and lessons learned
